The problem is approached by modeling the scenario as a graph where each seat in the grid represents a node, and permissible movements between seats represent weighted edges. The goal is to determine the optimal sequence of passes among cheaters to minimize the total cost, considering the constraints and costs associated with different types of passes.

**Graph Construction:**

1. **Nodes:** Each seat in the grid is treated as a node.

2. **Edges:** Edges are established between nodes based on possible passing actions:

   - **Direct Throw:** An edge between two cheaters in the same row or column, with a weight equal to the product of distance and cost A.

   - **Relay Through Gaps:** For cheaters separated by non-cheaters, edges are added with weights reflecting the relay cost through non-cheaters, calculated as the number of relays multiplied by cost B.

**Conversion Heuristic:**

To potentially reduce passing costs, non-cheaters are considered for conversion to cheaters if the cost of relaying through them exceeds the conversion cost C. Specifically, for gaps between cheaters:

- If the relay cost (B times the gap size) is greater than the conversion cost (C times the gap size), the non-cheaters in the gap are converted to cheaters.

**Pathfinding with Dijkstra's Algorithm:**

With the graph constructed, Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest path between the first and last cheater in each row and column:

- **Initialization:** Set the initial distances to infinity, except for the source node set to zero.

- **Priority Queue:** Utilize a priority queue to repeatedly select the node with the smallest known distance.

- **Relaxation:** For each selected node, update the distances to its adjacent nodes if a shorter path is found through the current node.

- **Termination:** Continue the process until the shortest path to the target node is determined.

This method ensures that the sequence of passes among cheaters is optimized to achieve the minimum possible total cost, adhering to the given constraints and cost parameters.
